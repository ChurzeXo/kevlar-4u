> **It simulates real reactions from different audiences — casual users, picky netizens, technical users, media perspectives — helping you spot expression issues, misunderstandings, and communication risks before you publish.**

---

Drop any content you're about to publish — **articles, tweets, video scripts, product intros, press releases, announcements, Reddit posts, V2EX posts, Hacker News headlines** — directly into Kevlar-4u. It won't just say "looks good." Instead, it'll **question, misinterpret, roast, nitpick, and comprehension-test** your content, just like the real internet.

Writers often suffer from the **"curse of knowledge"**:
You think you've made it clear, but others don't get it.
You think the key point stands out, but readers can't tell what you're trying to say.

And most platforms don't offer a real **A/B test**. Once content goes live, by the time the **first wave of organic traffic** passes, it's usually too late to revise.

**Kevlar-4u helps you surface these problems before you hit publish.**

## Core Features

### 1. Highly Customizable Reviewers (Persona Customization)

Break out of the single-AI perspective with comprehensive persona customization:

- **Core attributes**: Age, interests, personality, tone of voice.
- **RST (Reaction Simulation Taxonomy)**: Four-layer internet reaction simulation — choose an archetype (e.g., "Anti-Marketing Detector"), content sensitivity triggers, regional cultural context, and platform culture. The system simulates how real internet users react, not just how reviewers evaluate.
- **Cognition & relationship**: Define blind spots (e.g., domain-specific biases) and social relationship with the author (e.g., a strict mentor, a radical opponent).
- **Natural language creation**: Describe your ideal reviewer in plain text (e.g., "a cynical HN user who hates buzzwords"), and the system auto-parses it into a full RST configuration.

### 2. Two-Stage Review Pipeline

- **Stage 1 — System Pre-audit**: Five specialized system auditors scan content for compliance, context distortion, network culture risks, factual errors, and social risk — producing a structured findings report.
- **Stage 2 — RST Review**: User-created reviewers with RST personalities receive **Focus Topics** (filtered + translated from pre-audit findings) and produce authentic user reactions, not dimension-scored reports.

---

## Quick Start

Requires **Node.js 20+**.

## Usage Guide

### Core Workflow

All core operations in Kevlar-4u are handled through Wizard tools — just tell the AI what you want in natural language, and Kevlar-4u takes care of the rest.

### Recommended Tool Flow

| Wizard Tool | Purpose | Key Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `review_content_wizard` | Review content | Submit content → Select platform → Pick reviewers → Confirm → Multi-dimensional feedback |
| `create_persona_wizard` | Create a persona | Describe the role → Fill 6 attributes (age/interests/traits/tone/platform/relation) → Preview → Confirm → Save persona |
| `delete_persona_wizard` | Delete a persona | Select target → Reply `确认删除{persona name}` → Done |
| `configure_wizard` | Modify config | Preview changes → Reply `确认修改配置` → Write |

Low-level direct tools (suitable for automation scripts):

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `delete_persona` | Delete persona directly (requires `confirm: true`) |
| `configure` | Write config directly |
| `get_execution_modes` | Check current mode and availability |
| `list_personas` | List local personas |
| `kevlar_help` | View help |

### Content Review Flow

`review_content_wizard` chains "pre-audit, reviewer selection, Focus Topic transformation, RST review" into a stable flow.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Submit content"] --> B["Stage 1: System Pre-audit"]
  B --> C["5 system auditors scan in parallel"]
  C --> D["Raw findings report"]
  D --> E{"Any user personas?"}
  E -->|No| F["Prompt to create persona, save state"]
  F -.->|"Same sessionId"| E
  E -->|Yes| G["Select reviewers (RST recommended or manual)"]
  G --> H["Focus Topic transformation"]
  H --> I["Filter findings by reviewer's RST triggers"]
  I --> J["Translate to natural-language prompts"]
  J --> K["Stage 2: RST Review"]
  K --> L["Each reviewer produces authentic user reaction"]
  L --> M["Aggregated report"]
```

### Creating a Reviewer Persona

`create_persona_wizard` guides you through persona creation with RST support.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Age range"] --> B["Interests"]
  B --> C["Personality traits"]
  C --> D["Tone of voice"]
  D --> E["Platform"]
  E --> F["Author relation"]
  F --> G["Perspective / RST archetype"]
  G --> H["Final confirmation & preview"]
  H -->|Confirm| I["Save persona"]
  H -->|Edit| G
```

You can select a traditional perspective preset (9 options) or an **RST archetype** (8 options). RST archetypes auto-configure triggers, regional context, and platform culture. You can also describe your ideal reviewer in natural language (e.g., "a skeptical tech user on HN") and the system will parse it into a full RST config.

After creation, Kevlar-4u automatically infers the cultural background, blind spots, and behavior hints, saving them to `skills/*.json` (routed by platform tag — see [Architecture](#architecture-overview)).

---

## Execution Modes

Kevlar-4u supports three execution modes. The default `auto` selects the best mode based on your environment.

| Mode | Identifier | Description | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MCP Sampling | `mcp_sampling` | Each reviewer gets an independent sampling request, maximum isolation | Clients that support Sampling, pursuing authentic multi-perspective review |
| Direct API | `direct_api` | Directly calls external model API | Clients without Sampling, or script automation |
| Orchestration (Host-assisted fallback) | `orchestration` | Host AI assists completion, low-isolation fallback | Last resort when neither Sampling nor API Key is available |

`auto` mode resolution order:

1. Uses the mode specified in `skills/kevlar-config.json` (if set)
2. Otherwise reads the `KEVLAR_MODE` environment variable
3. Otherwise auto-selects by availability: `mcp_sampling` → `direct_api` → `orchestration`

---

## Configuration

### Runtime Configuration

Use `configure_wizard` to modify runtime preferences. Configuration is written to `skills/kevlar-config.json` (local only, not committed to the repository).

```json
{
  "mode": "auto",
  "multiAgent": {
    "maxConcurrency": 3
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KEVLAR_MODE` | `auto` | `auto`, `orchestration`, `mcp_sampling`, `direct_api` |
| `KEVLAR_MAX_CONCURRENT` | `3` | Max concurrent reviewers |
| `KEVLAR_TOKEN_BUDGET_PER_TASK` | `50000` | Token budget per review task |
| `KEVLAR_MIN_DELAY_MS` | `1000` | Minimum delay between requests |
| `KEVLAR_SKILLS_DIR` | `<repo>/skills` | Custom persona and config directory |
| `KEVLAR_API_KEY` | — | Preferred Direct API key |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | OpenAI API key |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

> API keys are read from environment variables only — they are never written to config files.

### Manual MCP Client Configuration

Claude Desktop example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kevlar-4u": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/kevlar-4u/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "KEVLAR_MODE": "auto",
        "KEVLAR_MAX_CONCURRENT": "3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Custom persona directory:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "KEVLAR_SKILLS_DIR": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/skills"
  }
}
```

---

## Security Boundaries

- `sessionId` only allows `[a-z0-9-]`.
- Persona write and delete operations are restricted to the `skills/` directory via path validation.
- Runtime drafts and wizard states are stored in `skills/tmp/`, with expired drafts cleaned up on startup.
- Deleting a persona requires selecting a target and replying with the full confirmation phrase.
- Config changes require preview before confirmation.
- API keys are never passed via tool parameters or written to local config.
- Non-`orchestration` modes use a review lock to prevent resource contention between multiple external model tasks.

---

## Architecture Overview

Kevlar-4u uses a **Server-side Workflow + Execution Layer** architecture.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  User["User"] --> Client["MCP Client / Host AI"]
  Client --> Tools["Kevlar-4u MCP Tools"]
  Tools --> Wizards["Server-side State Machine Wizards"]
  Tools --> Execution["Multi-mode Execution Layer"]
  Wizards --> Tmp["skills/tmp Session State"]
  Execution --> Personas["skills/*.json Personas & Rules"]
  Execution --> Report["Structured Review Report"]
```

Design principles:

- **State machine-driven workflows**: Key flows are maintained by tool state machines, not dependent on the host AI remembering long prompts.
- **AI handles understanding & expression**: AI handles natural language extraction, refinement, and recommendations, while results are written to Kevlar-4u-verifiable state.
- **Adaptive execution**: When MCP Sampling is available, use it for field extraction and reviewer recommendations; otherwise, fall back to heuristic logic or host-assisted orchestration.
- **Safe confirmation**: High-risk operations like deletion, reset, and config writes all go through confirmation wizards.

## Data Storage

### Personas

Personas are stored in **multi-file JSON** format under `skills/`. Each persona file contains a `version`, `last_updated`, and `personas` map:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "last_updated": "2026-05-28",
  "personas": {
    "analytical_zhihu": {
      "meta": {
        "id": "analytical_zhihu",
        "name": "理性知乎人",
        "tags": ["知乎", "理性分析"],
        "tone": ["专业", "严谨"],
        "dimensionBias": {
          "entries": [
            { "dimension": "information_gap", "weight": "focus" },
            { "dimension": "differentiation", "weight": "focus" }
          ]
        },
        "rst": {
          "archetypes": ["technical_reviewer"],
          "triggers": ["ai_writing", "overhyped", "data_credibility"],
          "regionalPack": "china",
          "platformCulture": "zhihu"
        }
      },
      "systemPrompt": "你是一位活跃在知乎的用户..."
    }
  }
}
```

Files are routed by tag:

| Tag | Target File | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `system_auditor` | `auditors.json` | System pre-screening auditors |
| `"小红书"` | `xiaohongshu.json` | Platform-specific user personas |
| `"知乎"` | `zhihu.json` | Platform-specific user personas |
| *(unknown)* | `fallback.json` | Catch-all for unrecognised platforms |

New persona files are auto-detected at startup via content sniffing (presence of a `personas` key). Adding a new platform requires only placing a JSON file in `skills/`.

### Rules

Semantic risk rules live in `skills/rules.json` and are accessed through the DAO layer (`src/dao/`):

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "categories": {
    "food": {
      "enabled": true,
      "associative_map": [
        {
          "root": "不新鲜",
          "variants": ["食材不新鲜", "东西不新鲜"],
          "misinterpret_direction": "可能被误解为食品安全问题",
          "severity": "medium"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Creating Personas

Use the `create_persona_wizard` tool — it guides you through age, interests, traits, tone, platform, author relation, and **RST archetype selection**. You can also describe your ideal reviewer in natural language (e.g., "a sarcastic tech user on Hacker News who hates marketing fluff") and the system will auto-parse it into a full RST configuration. The persona is automatically saved to the correct platform JSON file. No manual file editing is needed.

## Pre-Release Checklist

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

Before release, it is recommended to hand [docs/PRE_RELEASE_AUDIT_REQUEST.md](docs/PRE_RELEASE_AUDIT_REQUEST.md) to your local AI for an independent audit.
